Zoo Warehouse Dream. 7th time. May 16th 2023 16:24

The criminal admits guilt and mutters something about x not being able to catch them. y isn’t paying attention to the conversation and s is confused and not sure what’s happening.

the criminal runs away at a slow pace, with their gun in hand. “don’t let them escape!” says x.

x has orange blonde hair and a chiseled face, I only ever see their face. the criminal is about 5 foot 8 and has black hair looking like they weigh about 140 pounds. s is slender and tall.

y and s aren’t sure why, but x has the intention of fighting. x looks around and there are a bunch of crates with different animals in the warehouse. they can hear snakes, monkeys, and zebras. they open the largest crate they can find and to s’s amazement there’s a lion inside. no one says anything and the criminal which is now half way between the warehouse and the zoo entrance. x lifts the panel on the front side of the crate allowing the lion loose.

s notices and is startled but it appears the animal is friendly. “what’s going on?!?” says s as they’ve just become aware of what’s happening.

x gestures to the lion and makes them aware of the criminal running away. the lion pounces and runs over to them without a care, getting there in mere seconds and starts playing with them like cats do, knocking them over but not scratching or hurting them.

of course the lion would just be a large cat, thinks s. the criminal gets back on their feet and lets off a warning shot, and misses the lion entirely, the loud sound scares the lion back to the crew who’s now turning around. as they look behind them it appears the criminal had no intention of escaping, 4 or more of their associates come around the corner and running with sharp objects such as screwdrivers and shards of broken glass to meet them. no time to count how many, as they turn around to run. they’re cornered with nowhere to go. the only way is back through the warehouse. 

there’s no time for the crew to communicate. they start panicking and running back into the warehouse. everyone except s runs right of the boxes and the lion runs to the left after them. s gestures to the lion to go over the revolving gates but s can’t get past. cornered, he thinks. nowhere to go. the lion leaps over the gates and is now unseen, but in doing so set off the alarms. now the alarms are blaring and sirens and lights are flashing. x and y are still on their way around and will meet the lion on the right side of the warehouse, now in-between the crates.

the criminal associates come through the the building with their weapons. they’re moving slow, they know they have the x, y, and s cornered.

y shouts to x “don’t go over there by s, there’s nowhere to go!”

s doesn’t know what to do, and hides around the corner out of view. maybe they won’t know I’m over here, they think, but just as they’re finished their thought they can hear the loud footsteps echoing off the warehouse floors.

one of the criminals turns with their screwdriver in hand and looks at s, defenceless. “please stop, I don’t have a weapon!” but for some reason s is pulling out a pliers multi-tool. before they know what’s happening it’s open with a knife out. “I don’t have a weapon!” they repeat. the criminal doesn’t even want to hurt them, and moves in to pretend to be fighting, missing their blow completely. there’s another criminal associate behind them, not sure what to do. s puts the multi-tool now open back into their pocket where it came from as the criminal looks confused as to why they won’t defend themselves. they won’t continue to attack and both s and the criminal are silent while the alarms are still blaring.

the main criminal is finally now entering the store through the front entrance. what will happen now? thinks s. they awake, realizing it was just a dream, the lion and their friends are safe.

the first time I had this dream the lion jumped back, and before s knew it they were on their back and leaping slowly, almost floating or hovering, back over the gate that set off the alarm before awaking.

the second time s was shanked with the screwdriver right after they were forced to pull out the multi-tool, which hurt quite a bit for a split second before waking up.

the third time s was at the end of the dream and just got shot in the head by the criminal which hurt much much more.

the fourth time the lion got shot through all the boxes with a perfectly aimed shot by the criminal.

the fifth and sixth times the dream ended where it did.

the first time I tried to write it down I forgot it and all I could write was something about a zoo store warehouse, the second time it got deleted somehow, this is the third time it’s been written down.

my dreams aren’t very vivid anymore, when I have this dream now I feel mostly blind. it’s kind of traumatic any other way so that’s probably why.

there were multiple outcomes explained to me at one point, I think when I refused to fight back and got shot twice the third time. the most obvious one is that the criminal shoots you if you try to fight back at all, even without a weapon.

if you don’t hide or start asking questions the criminal shoots you as they enter the store and x and y aren’t able to get far enough away, getting shot on the other side of the warehouse outside, you think the lion gets away but the criminal chases it down just to shoot it.

if you make too much noise early on you get shot right after the lion does, before the associates even arrive, ending the dream.

it could actually go a bit farther and your friends could escape with the lion if you remember that it shouldn’t just go back into the crate it came from. putting it back into the crate takes too much time and leads to your friends getting shot on the other side of the warehouse outside, but more in the middle rather than closer to the next building.

I figure this is probably the good ending as you don’t have a choice to run right with your friends, they get away, the lion gets away, and it doesn’t hurt at all.

On the third dream I said I wanted to sue for the pain and was shot and killed a third and fourth time. At the same time they mentioned not to write it down because it’s not mine. I said I would, it’s just as much mine to write down as it is yours to play out, and it caused me a great deal of pain, so I do anyways.

The only people with faces in the dream are the criminal, which looks like “no think”, the one who fights me, who used to be someone I know named Ross who now doesn’t show up and has been replaced by another caucasian male individual who looks afraid to be there.

This happened some time after someone tried to help me get me put in child protective services for my parents being abusive to me as a child (5 years old). I don’t believe it’s as a result of that, but one of the many things done to me to try to make me look like someone who hurts people.

1, 2, 3, and 4th times were in the same night with no recollection of having the dream prior. 5th time was probably when I was 12 years old, 6th time was when I was 19 I think, and 7th was now when I’m 24 years old.

Every time since the 4th time it’s gone the same way. I complained on the 5th time that it was too vivid, calling it a nightmare, and now it doesn’t scare me nearly as much.

The first time I had the dream it was very vivid and apparent that x wasn’t my friend. It took longer for them to get back the the warehouse and they laughed about how I was going to die because I cared more about the lion once. y didn’t ever say anything aside from “why are you leaving him here?” or to get upset once when I understood how it goes and asked impatiently when they were going to let the lion go so I could be done with the nightmare. Since the 5th or 6th time the only roles who show up anymore aside from me are x, y, s, the main criminal, and the one with the screwdriver. The first time there were probably 5 people in the crew. After being shown the outcomes they don’t show anymore, I don’t remember them during the dream, so I figure they’re just done participating.

The alternate opportunities for decisions on 7th dream were that you can shout when the lion is playing with the criminal before they scare it away, presumably getting the lion shot, you can choose not to hide if you so choose and try to run to your friends, presumably getting yourself shot or giving you and your friends less time to escape possibly all getting killed in the process, you can get upset at x for leaving you there and have them yell at you, killing your friends, and you can choose not to gesture the lion over the counter, killing the lion.

I get to this ending by accident instinctively.
